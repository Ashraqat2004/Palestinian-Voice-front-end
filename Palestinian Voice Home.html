                <h2>Israeli actress Gal Gadot forced to stop filming The <br> Runner after pro-Palestine protesters swarm London set</h2>
                <p class="description">
                    Gal Gadot was said to be fuming after a group of pro-Palestine protesters swarmed the set of her new movie The Runner and interrupted filming.

                    The Israeli actress, who has been vocal in her support of the war against Hamas, was escorted off set as activists brandishing flags shouted 'stop bombing Palestine' through a megaphone.

                    One man was also seen banging a drum to cause maximum disruption to the filming that was taking place by a canal in Camden, north London, on Wednesday.

                            an Israeli strike hit a tent on the side of the road, killing Massa and some of the other children. Her older brother, 16, grabbed Massa’s little body and rushed to the hospital on a donkey cart. When she was pronounced dead, he wailed, holding her. Days later, Massa’s father, Samy Abed, turned the green ball in his hand, describing the incident to The Associated Press.
