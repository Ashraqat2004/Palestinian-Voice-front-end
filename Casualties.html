            <h2>Death Count since Oct 7th:</h2>
            <p>
                The death toll has risen to more than 61,700, with thousands still missing under the rubble and presumed dead.
                Following the breakdown of the ceasefire, at least 322 children have reportedly been killed in the Gaza Strip, bringing the total number of children killed to over 15,000.
                According to the UN, nearly 70% of the verified war dead in Gaza are women and children, and about 80% of the victims were killed in residential buildings or similar housing.
                Over the past year, more women and children have been killed in Gaza by the Israeli military than during the equivalent period of any other conflict over the past two decades.
                And all of this has only been happening since 7 October.

            <h2>Wounded Palestnians since Oct 7th:</h2>
            <p>
                After nearly 18 months of war, over 34,000 have reportedly been injured, and nearly one million children have been repeatedly displaced and deprived of their right to basic services. No aid has been allowed into the Gaza Strip since 2 March—representing the
                longest period of aid blockage since the start of the war—so food, safe water, shelter, and medical care have become increasingly scarce. Without these essential supplies, malnutrition, diseases, and other preventable conditions will likely surge, leading to an increase in preventable child deaths.
                And this has only been happening since 7 October.

            <h2>Average daily death since Oct 7th:</h2>
            <p>
                Israel’s military is killing Palestinians at an average rate of 250 people per day, exceeding the daily death toll of any other major conflict in recent years.
                The Euro-Med Monitor reported that preliminary statistics show the daily death toll prior to the humanitarian truce ranged between 300 and 350 deaths per day, but has now risen to more than 500 since Israel resumed its attacks for the sixth consecutive day.
                And all of this has only been happening since 7 October.

            <h2>Air strikes on Gaza since Oct 7th:</h2>
            <p>
                On a never-before-seen scale, Israel’s extensive bombing campaign has targeted both displaced civilians and civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, UN-run schools, mosques, churches, bakeries, water tanks, and even ambulances.
                An Israeli airstrike has also destroyed part of the last fully functional hospital in Gaza City.
                And all of this has only been happening since 7 October.
