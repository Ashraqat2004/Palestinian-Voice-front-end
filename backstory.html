                    region roughly corresponding to the Land of Israel in Judaism, with central importance in Jewish
                    history. Zionists wanted to create a Jewish state in Palestine with as much land, as many Jews, and
                    as few Palestinian Arabs as possible. And after the victory of the British in the 1st world war the

                <h2>HOLOCAUST 1941–1945 (World War II)</h2>
                <p>
                    With the start of the second World War and a swift succession of German victories,
                    the Nazi regime began realizing its longstanding goal of territorial expansion.
                    Under conditions of war and military occupation, they could pursue racial goals with more radical
                    measures.
                    The German Army, military, SS, and German police units took an active part in authorized mass
                    murders of Jews
                    in the Soviet Union. The Germans and their collaborators deported roughly 2.7 million Jews
                    and others from occupied Europe to killing centers in German-occupied Poland. At the largest of the
                    camps,
                    Auschwitz-Birkenau, transports arrived from all across Europe. The camps of Majdanek and Auschwitz
                    were the first liberated,
                    as Soviet troops reached Poland. As more Allied soldiers saw the camps with their own eyes, the
                    truth was undeniable.

                <h2> Arab-Israeli War 1948–1949</h2>
                <p>
                    The war had two main phases, <span class="special"> the first being the 1947–1948 civil war </span>,
                    which began on 30 November 1947, a day after the United Nations voted to adopt the Partition Plan for Palestine,
                    which planned for the division
                    of the territory into Jewish and Arab sovereign states. During this period the British still maintained a
                    declining rule over Palestine and occasionally intervened in the violence. Initially on the defensive,
                    the Zionist forces switched to the offensive in April 1948. In anticipation of an invasion by Arab armies,
                    they enacted Plan Dalet, an operation aimed at securing territory for the establishment of a Jewish state.

                    <span class="special"> The second phase of the war began on 14 May 1948</span>, with the termination of the
                    British Mandate and the declaration of the establishment of the State of Israel. The following morning,
                    the surrounding Arab armies invaded Palestine, beginning the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. The Egyptians advanced
                    in the south-east while the Jordanian Arab Legion and Iraqi forces captured the central highlands.
                    Syria and Lebanon fought with the Israeli forces in the north.  The newly formed Israel Defense Forces managed to
                    halt the Arab forces and in the following months began pushing them back and capturing territory.
